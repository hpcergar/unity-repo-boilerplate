# Unity game repo boilerplate
Barebones repository with the main configuration required to setup your Unity project for Git.

# How to
* With your project open in the Unity editor:
* Open the editor settings window: `Edit > Project Settings > Editor`    
* Make .meta files visible to avoid broken object references: `Version Control / Mode: “Visible Meta Files”`
* Use plain text serialization to avoid unresolvable merge conflicts: `Asset Serialization / Mode: “Force Text”`
* Save your changes: `File > Save Project`
